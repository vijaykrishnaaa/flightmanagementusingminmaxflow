Enhanced Flight Management System Using Max-Flow Algorithm
This project details the implementation of a flight management system that leverages the Push-Relabel max-flow algorithm for efficient and dynamic passenger allocation. The system is designed to handle real-world scenarios such as flight cancellations, capacity adjustments, and passenger re-routing, ensuring optimal resource utilization and passenger satisfaction.

üìù Problem Definition
The primary goal is to develop a resilient and adaptable system that optimizes passenger allocation in a dynamic flight network. This involves addressing three core challenges:


Efficient Passenger Allocation: Maximize the total number of passengers assigned to flights based on available capacity and existing demand.


Dynamic Flight Management: Adapt to real-time changes, such as flight cancellations and seat capacity adjustments, to minimize disruption for passengers.


Waiting Lists and Refunds: Implement robust mechanisms for managing waiting lists and processing refunds for passengers affected by flight changes.

üß† Algorithm Design
The system's core logic is built around the 

Push-Relabel max-flow algorithm. This algorithm determines the maximum flow of passengers from a source (all potential passengers) to a sink (completed trips) through the flight network.


Graph Construction
The flight network is modeled as a directed graph:


Nodes:


Source Node: Represents the pool of all passengers.


Flight Nodes: Each node represents a specific flight.


Capacity Nodes: Helper nodes that enforce seating limits for each flight.



Sink Node: Represents all passengers who have successfully completed their trips.



Edges:


Source ‚Üí Flights: Represents passenger demand with limits.


Flights ‚Üí Capacity Nodes: Represents the maximum seat availability on a flight.


Capacity Nodes ‚Üí Sink: Directs allocated passengers toward the sink.

Push-Relabel Operations
The algorithm iteratively performs two main operations until no more flow can be moved through the network:


Push: Moves excess flow from a node to a neighboring node that has a lower height, provided there is available capacity.


Relabel: Increases the height of a node if it has excess flow but cannot push it to any of its neighbors.

‚ú® Features
The system implements several key features to manage the flight network dynamically:


Optimal Passenger Allocation: Utilizes the max-flow algorithm to find the best possible passenger distribution across available flights.


Dynamic Capacity Adjustments: Allows for real-time changes to seat availability on any flight.


Flight Cancellation Handling: Automatically reallocates passengers from a canceled flight to other available flights, minimizing disruption.



Waiting Lists & Refunds: Manages waiting lists for fully booked flights and provides refund options for passengers who cannot be reallocated.


Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of the core operations is as follows:

Operation	Time Complexity

Here, 

V is the number of vertices (flights/nodes), E is the number of edges (connections), and N is the number of available flights for reallocation.
